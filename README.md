# Credit-Card-Application-Approval-Model

The task is to build a credit card approval model that predicts whether a customer's credit card is delinquent or not, solely based on the customer's application data. This problem statement is a binary classification problem to identify whether the customer is delinquent or not.
In this case study, I used the credit card performance data to create the target variable, i.e., whether the customer's credit card is delinquent or not. The user ID will be classified as delinquent if the customer has ever delayed their payment by more than 60 days. 
TO find the most important features, I used the Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value (IF) before building the model using Logistic Regression.
